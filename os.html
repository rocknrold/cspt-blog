<h3><strong><em>What is an Operating System?</em></strong></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-left">An operating system (OS) in a basic definition is an intermediary interface/software that connects a computer user to the hardware. </p>



<p>Remember on the previous topic from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://itecharon.000webhostapp.com/2021/02/16/computer-hardware-system/" target="_blank">computer hardware systems</a> the layer on the middle that&#8217;s sits between the hardware layer and the application layer is the Operating system and known as the OS for short. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><figcaption>Computer Architectural Layers</figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center" style="background-color:#fcf403">Software Layer</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center" style="background-color:#fcb103">Application/ Utility Layer</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center" style="background-color:#fc6f03">Operating System </td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center" style="background-color:#e35036">Hardware Layer</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p class="wp-block-verse">The above figure shows that the Operating System is in between the Software Layer where user interacts and the hardware layer where the OS controls and communicates to.</p>



<h3><strong><em>What Operating Systems Do</em>?</strong></h3>



<p> Another way to look on OS is that,  operating system is a piece of software that manages files, manages memory, manages processes, handles input and output, and controls peripheral devices like disk drives and printers, among other things.</p>



<p>A government is comparable to an operating system. That, like the nation, has little valuable purpose of its own. It essentially creates a setting in which other programs can perform useful tasks.</p>



<p>Operating Systems examples are : </p>



<ul><li>UNIX</li><li>GNU\Linux</li><li>Windows </li><li>MacOS</li><li>Android</li></ul>



<p>And this is not limited only with those listed above they are just the major and known operating systems ever used. </p>



<h3><em><strong>Operating-System Operations</strong></em></h3>



<h4><em><strong>Process Management</strong></em></h4>



<p>In a structure, a process is the unit of work. A system is made up of a number of processes, some of which are operating-system processes (those that run system code) and others which run user code. By multiplexing on a single CPU, for example, both of these processes may actually run at the same time. The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with process management:</p>



<ul><li>Scheduling processes and threads on the CPUs</li><li>Creating and deleting both user and system processes</li><li>Suspending and resuming processes</li><li>Providing mechanisms for process synchronization</li><li>Providing mechanisms for process communication</li></ul>



<h4><em><strong>Memory Management</strong></em></h4>



<p>General-purpose machines must retain many programs in memory to increase both CPU efficiency and the speed at which the machine responds to its users, necessitating memory management. There are several memory management systems in use. These schemes represent a variety of methods, and the success of each algorithm varies depending on the case. When it comes to memory control software, there are a few things to consider.</p>



<p>The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with memory management:</p>



<ul><li> Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and who is using them</li><li>Deciding which processes (or parts of processes) and data to move into and out of memory</li><li> Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed</li></ul>



<h4><strong><em>Storage Management</em></strong></h4>



<p>The operating system offers a structured, logical vision of information storage to make the data system more user-friendly. To describe a logical storage unit, the disk, the operating system abstracts from the physical properties of its storage devices. Files are mapped into physical media by the operating system, which then accesses them through storage devices.</p>



<p>The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with file management:</p>



<ul><li>Creating and deleting files</li><li>Creating and deleting directories to organize files</li><li>Supporting primitives for manipulating files and directories</li><li>Mapping files onto secondary storage</li><li>Backing up files on stable (nonvolatile) storage media</li></ul>



<h4><em><strong>Protection and Security</strong></em></h4>



<p>If a computer system has multiple users and requires multiple processes to run at the same time, data access must be controlled. Mechanisms ensure that only certain processes that have received proper permission from the operating system can access directories, memory segments, CPU, and other resources. </p>



<p>Memory-addressing hardware, for example, means that a process can only run within its own address space. No mechanism will gain hold of the CPU without ultimately relinquishing it, thanks to the timer. The security of the different peripheral systems is preserved and device-control registers are not open to users.</p>



<h4><strong><em>Kernel </em></strong></h4>



<p>Many kernel-mode processes can be involved in the operating system at any given time. As a result, there are many potential race conditions in the code that implements an operating system (kernel code). Consider a kernel data structure that keeps track of all the available files in the system. When a new file is opened or closed, this list must be updated (by adding the file to the list). </p>



<p>The different changes to this list could trigger a race condition if two processes open files at the same time. Structures for managing memory allocation, process lists, and interrupt management are examples of kernel data structures that are vulnerable to race conditions. Kernel engineers are responsible for ensuring that the operating system is free of certain race conditions.</p>



<h3><em><strong>Different Technologies Applied</strong></em></h3>



<h4><em><strong>Mainframes</strong></em></h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Computing started as an experiment to determine what could be done and quickly moved to fixed-purpose systems for military uses, such as code breaking and trajectory plotting, and governmental uses, such as census calculation. Those early computers evolved into general-purpose, multifunction mainframes, and that‚Äôs when operating systems were born. In the 1960s, Moore‚Äôs Law predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every eighteen months, and that prediction has held true. Computers gained in functionality and shrunk in size, leading to a vast number of uses and a vast number and variety of operating systems.</p></blockquote>



<h4><strong><em>Mobile devices</em> Operating System</strong></h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Today, however, if we look at operating systems for mobile devices, we<br>see that once again the number of features constituting the operating system is increasing. Mobile operating systems often include not only a core kernel but also middleware‚Äîa set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers. For example, each of the two most prominent mobile operating systems‚ÄîApple‚Äôs iOS and Google‚Äôs Android‚Äîfeatures a core kernel along with middleware that supports databases, multimedia, and graphics (to name a only few).</p></blockquote>



<h4><strong><em>Network </em>Operating System</strong></h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A network operating system provides an environment in which users, who<br>are aware of the multiplicity of machines, can access remote resources by<br>either logging in to the appropriate remote machine or transferring data from the remote machine to their own machines. Currently, all general-purpose operating systems, and even embedded operating systems such as Android and iOS, are network operating systems.</p></blockquote>



<h4><em><strong>Embedded systems</strong></em></h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Embedded computers are the most prevalent form of computers in existence. These devices are found everywhere, from car engines and manufacturing robots to DVDs and microwave ovens. They tend to have very specific tasks. The systems they run on are usually primitive, and so the operating systems provide limited features. Usually, they have little or no user interface, preferring to spend their time monitoring and managing hardware devices, such as automobile engines and robotic arms.<br></p><p>These embedded systems vary considerably. Some are general-purpose<br>computers, running standard operating systems‚Äîsuch as Linux‚Äîwith<br>special-purpose applications to implement the functionality. Others are hardware devices with a special-purpose embedded operating system providing just the functionality desired. Yet others are hardware devices with application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that perform their tasks without an operating system.</p></blockquote>
