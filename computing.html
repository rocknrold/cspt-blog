<h3><em><strong>What is the role of computing platforms?</strong></em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Computing platforms comes in a various types and its usage in the industry and in the modern world were technology is in demand. In Information technology, computing platforms are used and has been a great help for almost all business and peoples lives such as developers. </p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>Computing</em></strong></p>



<p>Computing is the process of using computer technology to complete a given task and perform various operations  such as structuring, managing and processing any kind of information. </p>



<p>This does not only refer to the using of computers but rather a refers to any kind of devices or machines that can perform operations on information and is running on top of platforms. </p>



<p><strong><em>Platforms </em></strong></p>



<p>A platform is a collection of tools for creating, modifying, maintaining, and monitoring services and goods in the digital world. Cloud infrastructures, APIs, user interfaces, and everything else that can be used for configuring, designing, creating, and managing products are examples of those platforms.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Combining two concept, there we have Computing Platforms</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>Computing Platforms </em></strong></p>



<p>&nbsp;A computing platform allows software to run on the computer and requires a processor, operating system, and programming environment with related runtime libraries and user agents.</p>



<p>Computing platforms are usually used by IT specialists, development agencies, developer groups or single developers. Developers who use such platforms include software developers, game developers, web developers, Software as a Service developer, Platform as Service developers and others.</p>



<p><em><strong>Different kinds of computing platforms</strong></em></p>



<ul><li>Hardware Platforms </li><li>Operating Systems</li><li>Client/Server Platforms</li><li>Mobile Platforms </li><li>Cloud Platforms</li></ul>



<p>On this topic we&#8217;re focusing on the <strong><em>Cloud computing platforms</em> </strong>as it is also a popular type of computing platform. And a demand of jobs for cloud engineers are rising as it is also one of the path you can take after pursuing Information technology degree. </p>



<p><strong><em>Cloud computing platforms</em></strong> is used for development, deployment and managing cloud infrastructure technologies such as software and services over the internet. </p>



<p>It offers wide variety of usage and purposes depending on the need of an individual using or in a business transitioning to use these kind of computing platforms.  This cloud computing has been widely adapted in the business for the last decade up until now it is greatly improved. As it is a cost effective way to handle business need such as resources, and offers easy access and flexibility mainly for scalability, availability, maintainability and security for some types of cloud platforms. </p>



<p><strong><em>Most common cloud computing platforms</em></strong></p>



<p>Amazon Web Services : EC2, S3 BUCKETS</p>



<p>Google Cloud Compute Engines : Google Cloud Services </p>



<p>Microsoft Azure</p>



<p>The above mentioned are the most common and popular cloud computing platforms today. They offer large and multiple services that is suitable for the business needs. </p>



<p>Here is the service types/models cloud computing offers </p>



<img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/responsibilities-of-cloud-service-models-2-1-1024x953.png" width="100%">



<h3>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure‚Äîservers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems‚Äîfrom a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p></blockquote>



<h3>Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.</p></blockquote>



<h3>Software as a service (SaaS)</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>Technologies that uses cloud computing</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Docker </em></strong></p>



<p>Docker is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications. It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.</p>



<img src="https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/styles/large/public/2018-11/container-what-is-container.png?itok=vle7kjDj" width="100%">



<p><strong><em>Kubernetes </em></strong></p>



<p>Kubernetes (also known as k8s or &#8220;kube&#8221;)&nbsp;is an&nbsp;open source&nbsp;container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.</p>



<p>In other words, you can cluster together groups of hosts running Linux¬Æ containers, and Kubernetes helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters.</p>



<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*BZj4M6pvdfDuDF3k.png" width="100%">



<p>The above technologies are all powered by cloud computing platforms. As seen above docker lets you manage your codes or other set of technologies into a container then this containers are then used by kubernetes as it is responsible for orchestrating and managing for application deployments.</p>



<p><strong><em>Learn Cloud computing TODAY!</em></strong></p>



<p>Based on my experience as a student learning cloud computing, I recommend <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Qwiklabs </span>for learning hands on training with laboratory exercises.  You can directly access the laboratory and environment from cloud computing platforms especially google cloud. </p>



<p>With training to real cloud environment and google cloud compute platforms, includes topics like networking, operating systems,  website development for deployment, compute engines, load balancing, and etc.</p>
