This is also by the help of the standard mathematical systems of writing and expressing numbers. Hence in the example Binary&#8211;&gt;Hex&#8211;&gt;Decimal&#8211;&gt;ASCII-text the binary were now converted to human readable format which the computer processes for us. </span></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3 class="has-text-align-left"><strong><em>Determine the number</em></strong></h3>



<ul><li><em>The digit</em></li><li><em>Its position in the number</em></li><li><em>The base of the number system</em></li></ul>



<p>Number conversions are discussed so in this section let&#8217;s tackle about the different applications and uses of this number system on the information technology field specially for our computers. </p>



<h2><strong>Binary</strong> </h2>



<p><strong><em>Application of binary digit in computing: </em></strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The binary is the most important number system in a computing machine because it is the only numbers that a computer understand as it is the lowest/smallest unit of data for the computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>Binary digits &#8211; digits 0 and 1 &#8211; are used by computers to store data.  A 0 or a 1. is represented by it. Binary numbers, such as the binary number 1001, are made up of binary digits (bits).</p>



<p>Computer programs are instruction sets. Simple binary codes which activate the CPU are translated into machine code for each instruction. Programmers write computer code and this is converted into binary instructions by a compiler&nbsp;that can be executed by the computer.<br>Binary storage is also used to store all software, music, documents, and any other information that a computer processes.</p>



<h2><strong>HEX</strong></h2>



<p>One of astonishing uses of Hex or Hexadecimal number system in the computing world is that it is actually used in the computers memory typically addresses, that is used to points out where was the value or data is stored in the memory. </p>



<p>As for deep and fun learning about hex, watching the CS50 course offered by Harvard University is out for free on the internet it was the one of the best introductory course for computer science. I personally recommend this based from my experience enrolling to their online course.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here on the lecture 4 David Malan the professor from Harvard teaches how memory works and how the hexadecimal number system is helpful on many ways. </p><cite><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/spring/notes/4/">https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/spring/notes/4/</a></cite></blockquote>



<iframe loading="lazy" width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKTfNv2T0FE?start=49&amp;end=621&amp;autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>Mentioned in the video that the hexadecimal is also widely use on colors and it becomes a standard or convention to use the hexadecimal values when pertaining to colors, this is specially for programmers or developers and also for digital artist and designers. </p>



<p>Aside from hex being used for color to determine some amount of red, some amount of green, and some amount of blue. The hexadecimal number system is also used on identifying file signatures which indeed also useful for Digital Forensics field for examining type of files.  </p>



<p><strong><em>How hex is used on identifying files?</em></strong></p>



<p>Every file has a signature, also known as a file header, which defines what<br>type of file it is so that a program can properly recognize and associate it.<br>There are several thousand file types and out of those many have been<br>standardized by the International Standards Organization (ISO), and the<br>International Telecommunications Union, Telecommunication<br>Standardization Sector (ITU-T).</p>

<h2><strong>Octal </strong></h2>



<p>A fancy way to use the Octal number system on the computer is by this commonly used linux command which is the managing of file permissions.</p>



<p>Three commands control the permissions associated with a file:</p>



<ul><li><code>chown <em>user</em> <em>file</em></code>&nbsp;changes the owner of the file;</li><li><code>chgrp <em>group</em> <em>file</em></code>&nbsp;alters the owner group;</li><li><code>chmod <em>rights</em> <em>file</em></code>&nbsp;changes the permissions for the file.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>#</td><td>Permission</td><td>code</td><td>Binary</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>none</td><td>&#8212;</td><td>000</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>execute only</td><td>&#8211;x</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>write only</td><td>-w-</td><td>010</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>write and execute</td><td>-wx</td><td>011</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>read only</td><td>r&#8211;</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>read and execute</td><td>r-x</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>read and write</td><td>rw-</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>all permission</td><td>rwx</td><td>111</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Managing rights file permissions</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The (octal) numeric representation associates each right with a value: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute. We associate each combination of rights with the sum of the figures. Each value is then assigned to different categories of users by putting them end to end in the usual order (owner, group, others).</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>Decimal </strong></h2>



<p><em><strong>What is computers don&#8217;t use decimal?</strong></em></p>



<p>As for the decimal number system it is not very convenient to work this is kind of number system under the hood of the computer just for the sake of readability. But there was once a computer built to use decimal but then the later development of computers were change and use binary system instead as it is more faster and really good. </p>



<p><strong><em>Application of decimal number system in computing</em></strong>&#8230;.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In today&#8217;s technology the decimal number systems are just use on the interface of a computer like when you use a calculator application or a programming language.  </p><p>It is because decimal is a human readable and easy to understand number system which is why it is supposed to be for the visual representation of data from bits and bytes processed by the computer.  </p></blockquote>
