<h2><em><strong>What is Media Platforms?</strong> </em></h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A media platform is specifically a platform designed and built for the purpose of delivering certain media contents to a specific audience.

This involves translating all three elements of a digital video at the same time ‚Äî the file format, the video, and the audio. </p></blockquote>



<p>Media platforms are increasingly in demand of storage specially for contents such as videos because it has large file sizes and because of that media platforms converts these video format into a much more manageable formats and sizes, they create complex algorithms to do such things and also preserve the quality of video being streamed or watched. </p>
