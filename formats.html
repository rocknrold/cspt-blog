<h4><strong><em>Introduction to data formats</em></strong></h4>



<p>A data format in the field of Information Technology and related fields &#8211; may refer to be the way of interpretation of data in a format that is readable, visible, or in any arrangement that is structured as it is also represents real world things, like a still photo which in the computer world is identified as a JPG/JPEG or a PNG. Some elements like the sound which in a computer is used and identified as a MP3 or WAV. These formats are identified and classified with their extensions that is then standardized in the computers. </p>



<p><em><strong>In a computer it only understand one&#8217;s and zero&#8217;s and stores it&#8217;s data as a binary so how can it identify different formats?</strong></em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="156" src="./uploads/2021/02/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81" srcset="./uploads/2021/02/image.png 409w, ./uploads/2021/02/image-300x114.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></figure></div>



<p>Recall the purpose of hexadecimal and how it is used in the computing, they had made different standardization using hex as an identifier in a file. When looking on a file there is always this header on the beginning of it and when it is viewed or opened with a hex editor you can see the header in which can be matched on to the signatures.</p>

<h2><strong>Technologies <em>that use data fomats</em></strong></h2>



<h3><strong><em>IMAGES </em></strong></h3>



<p><em>IRIS Recognition</em> is a broadly used technique for biometric identification. It‚Äôs most common utility is in border safety checks, where a person‚Äôs identity is proven by way of scanning their iris. The identification is conducted by way of examining the unique patterns in the colored phase of the eye.</p>



<p>Were also familiar to these type of technology advancement for the computer visions because it is also used on some of modern consumer smartphone and same purpose was made and that is biometric identification.</p>

<h3><strong><em>VIDEO</em></strong></h3>



<p><em>CCTV </em>is a technology that is used to record videos 24/7 and it uses formats like mp4 or any equivalent. And we all know that videos are sequences of images that are on a 30 frames per second or 29,27 or something and the quality also like 360p or higher. </p>



<p><em>What is a cctv in short?</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">A <strong>sequence of images</strong> is picked up on through the camera, which is transmitted as a signal that passes on to recording system and display device. The digital camera itself captures the video source. At the the front of the digital camera is an opened aperture, and this is what captures the mild stream thru the lens. The light stream is captured by using a digital chip inside the digital camera and grew to become into a sequence of images. This digital camera records this sequence of photograph and transmits both via cable or wirelessly.</p>

<p></p>



<h3><strong><em>SOUND</em></strong></h3>



<p>One of the revolutionary technology that utilizes data formats like sounds which basically is of type like mp3 or any equivalent formats, this technology is the speech recognition technology which uses intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence underhood. The most common and popular virtual assistant&#8217;s are Google assistant, Siri, Cortana and Alexa they all used the same principle of speech recognition.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram from Google that explains how Actions/ Assistant interactions are processed.</p>



<a href="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*7jmZNu-Wbc7Z4Ulo.png"><img width="100%" src="https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/0*7jmZNu-Wbc7Z4Ulo.png" alt="google-assistant-architecture"></a>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A user‚Äôs interaction gets picked up by the device, converted to text that is parsed by the device, and passed to a&nbsp;DialogFlow&nbsp;agent which is a&nbsp;NLU engine. That then works out the ‚Äúintent‚Äù of the user‚Äôs statement (‚Äúphrase‚Äù or ‚Äúutterance‚Äù). That intent then gets matched to code that ‚Äúfulfills‚Äù the intent of the user, then returns a response that is (hopefully) appropriate and acceptable.</p></blockquote>



<p></p>



<h2><strong><em>OTHER FORMATS </em></strong></h2>



<p>Formats such as Documents, words, power points and comma separated values does uses its own extension to identify the type of file and what data thus it handle and can read. This software&#8217;s basically designed to read what is the certain type of data they are going to be using so formats are then formatted and processed for correct representation. </p>
