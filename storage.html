<h3><strong><em>What is a storage?</em></strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Data storage is the collective methods and technologies that capture and retain digital information on electromagnetic, optical or silicon-based&nbsp;storage media. Storage is a key component of digital devices, as consumers and businesses have come to rely on it to preserve information ranging from personal photos to business-critical information.</p></blockquote>



<h3><strong><em>Storage types</em></strong></h3>



<p>Before we dive into the storage platforms there are things we need to know about the different storage types that we are going to use to differentiate the platforms for storage. It is important to know how these types of storage is in used and as an IT professional to know what storage services or platforms to we need for our applications or systems or files.</p>



<h4><em><strong>DAS ( Direct Attached Storage )</strong> </em></h4>



<img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780124045576500094-u09-27-9780124045576.jpg?_">



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Direct-Attached Storage</strong></em>&nbsp;(DAS)&nbsp;<strong>refers to a digital storage system directly attached to a server or workstation, without a network in between</strong>. A typical DAS system is made of a&nbsp;data storage device&nbsp;(for example enclosures holding a number of hard disk drives) connected directly to a computer through a host bus adapter, which in the past used to be SCSI, but these days more often eSATA, SAS or Fiber Channel. The most important differentiation between DAS and NAS is that between the computer and DAS there is no network device (like a hub, switch, or router).</p></blockquote>



<h4><strong><em>NAS ( Network Attached Storage )</em></strong> <strong><em>or FILE STORAGE</em></strong></h4>



<img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780124045576500094-u09-28-9780124045576.jpg?_">



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>Network-Attached Storage</strong></em>&nbsp;(NAS) is a computer data storage connected to a network, providing data access to various group of clients. NAS not only operates as a file server, but it is also specialized for this task either by its hardware, software, or configuration of those elements. <strong>NAS systems are networked appliances which contain one or more hard drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers, or RAID.</strong></p></blockquote>



<ul><li>RAIDS drives that are attached to the network</li><li>Data replications</li><li>File collaborations, where people can access the same drive</li><li>Centralized controlled- ex:  Active Directory</li></ul>



<h4><strong><em>SAN ( Storage Area Network ) or BLOCK STORAGE</em></strong></h4>



<img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780124016736000088-f08-07-9780124016736.jpg?_">



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A storage-area network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed&nbsp;network&nbsp;(or&nbsp;subnetwork) that interconnects and presents shared pools of&nbsp;storage&nbsp;devices to multiple&nbsp;servers.</p><p>A SAN moves storage resources off the common user network and reorganizes them into an independent, high-performance network. This allows each server to access&nbsp;shared storage&nbsp;as if it were a drive directly attached to the server. When a&nbsp;host&nbsp;wants to access a storage device on the SAN, it sends out a&nbsp;block-based access request for the storage device.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>Broken into partitions with different file formats/filesystems</li><li>Hard Drive is partition for Ext4 filesystem, NTFS or etc.</li></ul>



<h4><strong><em>OBJECT STORAGE</em></strong></h4>



<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott-Brandt/publication/221397122/figure/fig1/AS:670014235475969@1536755250007/Distributed-Object-Storage-system-architecture.png">



<p>Object storage is a data storage strategy that sections data into distinct units, or objects, which are stored in an isolated storehouse along with all relevant metadata and a custom identifier.</p>



<ul><li>Files are stored as Objects</li><li>Access in HTTP requests</li><li>Backup of data, pictures, videos, CDN&#8217;s</li><li>Example is in Youtube Videos</li></ul>



<h3><strong><em>Different Storage Platforms</em></strong></h3>



<h4><strong><em>File Storage </em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>Google Cloud &#8220;Filestore&#8221;</strong></p>



<img src="https://sysadminxpert.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gcp-filestore-logo.jpg">



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Filestore offers low latency for file operations. For workloads that are latency sensitive, like electronic design automation (EDA), media rendering, data analytics, or other metadata intensive applications, Filestore supports capacity up to 320 TB and throughput of 16 GB/s and 480K IOPS, with minimal variability in&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/performance">performance</a>.</p></blockquote>



<ul><li>Fully managed network attached storage (NAS) for Compute Engine and GKE instances</li><li>Predictable price for performance</li><li>Scales to 100s of TBs for high-performance workloads</li></ul>



<h4><strong><em>Block Storage</em></strong></h4>



<p><strong>DigitalOcean</strong> <strong>&#8220;Volumes&#8221;</strong></p>



<img src="https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/benchmark-digitalocean-volumes/add-volume-gui.png" width="500px">



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Block storage volumes are network-based block devices that provide additional data storage for Droplets. You can move them between Droplets and resize them at any time.</p></blockquote>



<p>These volumes are used in the virtual machine created in the Digital Ocean. These can act as storage for cloud computing and or for databases, because SAN or Block storage are designed to be fast as it runs on the fiber optics.</p>



<h4>Object Storage</h4>



<p><strong>Amazon Web Services &#8220;S3&#8221;</strong></p>



<p><em>Object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere</em></p>



<img src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/product-page-diagrams/product-page-diagram_S3-Object-Lambda%402x_v1%20(1).4c44ce58a2df0aad0e3be25a31e24c56514aac1f.png" width="100%">



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, secure, fast, inexpensive infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<h3><strong><em>Technologies Applied</em></strong></h3>



<p><strong><em>Filestore for Data analytics</em></strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Compute complex financial models or analyze environmental data with Filestore. As capacity or performance needs change, easily grow or shrink your instances as needed. As a persistent and shareable storage layer, Filestore enables immediate access to data for high-performance,&nbsp;smart analytics&nbsp;without the need to lose valuable time on loading and off-loading data to clients‚Äô drives.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong><em>Volumes for Housing Storage</em></strong> <strong>such as Database</strong></p>



<ul><li>As the document root or media upload directory for a web server</li><li>To house database files for a database server</li><li>As a target location for backups</li><li>As expanded storage for personal file hosting platforms like ownCloud</li><li>As components for building more advanced storage solutions, like RAID arrays</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>S3 for Content Delivery Network (CDN)</em></strong></p>



<p>As stated above Object storage are best use in images or youtube videos or files that are unstructured because it is stored as objects with types of blobs. And in Object storage you cannot rewrite a file instead you have to do it again basically upload it again. In AWS S3 object storage are used as a CDN if only if the support is small but amazon offers another service that will be integrated to s3 incase the user grows.</p>



<p>In fact also the images I have used, some were using CDN and some are just hosted on the different storage services and it was just requested on to another services via GET request to the storage server hosting the images. </p>



<h4><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></h4>



<p>Based from the explanation above the storage comes from different types and different platforms utilizes this types of storage to design their platform architecture. And as an IT the need for knowing the storage types and platforms to use is as important as picking what kind of technology stack to use on building your applications and in fact theses storage are important in overall application needs.</p>
